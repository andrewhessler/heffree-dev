# About Me
Hey there! Welcome to my personal site.

My name is Andrew Hessler. I'm a software engineer with {{prof_years}} years of professional experience.

I really enjoy continuous learning and I want to be great at what I do.

I primarily use TypeScript and C# for my professional full-stack work.

I've mostly been messing around with Rust since the beginning of 2024. 
Before that I hadn't really created a ton in public, at least not code. Anyway, you can see what that's amounted to on my Github.
