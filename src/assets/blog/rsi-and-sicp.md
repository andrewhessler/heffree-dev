# RSI and SICP
I don't know why I'm combining these into one post, but they're happening concurrently and they're both acronyms so let's just roll with it.

## RSI
One thing about me is I like typing (neovim btw). I'm not **amazing** at it, there are people who type at speeds that absolutely floor me, but I love doing it and working on it.

### Ergonomics
On July 12th 2024, I started learning the alternative keyboard layout Colemak in an attempt to "ensure the health of my hands" (and somewhat to relearn touch typing from scratch).
I used a few different resources, typing constantly every day, learning my n-grams, and eventually pushing my WPM up.
I was doing most of this practice on my — looking at my email, apparently **new** — laptop from System76.

I actually found a blog post in my notes that I don't think I ever posted, written on August 12th, a month later.
I intended to post it on Reddit, but I think I figured no one would really care, haha.
I put in my notes: "Decided to give up on \[\[Typing Blog Post\]\] because it's mostly just bragging".
And now I've actually started a blog, crazy. As far as I can tell, the post is actually complete, maybe I'll post it on here.
Anyway, it mentions that my hands were sore during the transition, especially my pinkies, but it mostly cleared up within a month.
But I did have some concerns that the switch would be long-term detrimental for my hands. As far as I can tell though, it wasn't, and my hands went back to normal.

On September 6th 2024, I got my first ergonomic keyboard, the ZSA Moonlander. It took some getting used to and I took a small hit to my typing speed.
But after a couple days of practice I was back up to speed — my new slow Colemak speed. I had some additional pain with the transition, but that seemed to subside as well.

I wouldn't complain about fatigue or soreness in my hands until September of 2025.
I think somewhere around this point I started having really bad form with my Moonlander.
My hands had an insane positive tilt, I wasn't keeping them neutral at all and did a decent amount of damage to my hands.

It got really bad in early December, to the point that I started looking for an alternative keyboard to force me to correct my form once I started assuming it was the tilt's fault.
I landed on the Glove80. Mostly because I thought my body preferred negative tilt and that would just fix everything.
On December 5th 2025, I received my Glove80 and got to setting it up. I started using my thumbs for backspace and shift. It felt absolutely amazing to type on and...
I overdid it. I typed so much I actually ended up fully injuring my hands and had to completely scale back keyboard usage.

### Recovering
For work I switched over to doing everything with voice dictation and LLMs. 
I've gotten so many benefits from this experience of making my hands, essentially, temporarily useless. Some among them being: 
Voice dictation is pretty convenient and I really like VoiceInk, it's so snappy and local.
Also, Opus 4.5 is a beast and actually does what I tell it unlike so many other LLMs that bring with them so much noise.

As far as I can tell this is an acute injury, nothing chronic. I met with a physical therapist to get a plan together and learn more.
I was already working on rehauling my diet-and-exercise and had been stretching and building my forearms.
I've been hearing plenty of RSI war stories that are resolved by diet-and-exercise and I'm definitely starting to believe it.

Something else that seems pivotally important to recovery is some amount of optimism. Concern is good, worry is unproductive.
I ended up picking up "How to Stop Worrying and Start Living"
by Dale Carnegie while reading random posts on Eli Bendersky's blog where he recommended it.
Serendipitously, I only found his blog because I was looking up others' experiences with SICP.
Not often I get to use that word and I probably still shouldn't because it just sounds like I'm using word of the day toilet paper, oh well.

This book improved my peace of mind tenfold.
I've found I'm pretty susceptible to the placebo effect, most of my illnesses are immediately more manageable the moment I take medicine. I don't want to be too
self-evaluating here, but all this to say the book advised doing things that I knew to be helpful, but wasn't practicing to solve my immediate problems. The moment
I started practicing them, I felt some very immediate relief.

My physical therapist also recommended a book, "The Pain Management Workbook" by Rachel Zoffness,
which basically reinforces the idea that your body affects your mind affects your environment affects your body. The biopsychosocial cycle.

### Moving Forward
I typed up to this point for like an hour and a half straight! I feel some soreness in my forearms, but I don't fear that pain and I know it isn't permanent.
The best thing for me is to keep using my hands and building strength. Just have to make sure I don't injure them again, haha.
I'm hopeful I'll be back to near normal within a couple months.

I've honestly been having somewhat of a self-renaissance since July/August of 2024. I see all of this as just another branch of that.
I'm learning more about myself, what's important to me, and what will increase my happiness.
Along those lines, if this were a chronic pain, I'd like to imagine I'm in a place where I could accept that and modify my life and mindset as necessary.

## SICP
Well, now that we're through all that, let's talk about what I've been focused on most while letting my hands rest:
"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman with Julie Sussman.
