    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hey there! Welcome to my personal site.</p>

    <p>My name is Andrew Hessler. I'm a software engineer with 8 years (since 2017) of professional experience.</p>

    <p>I really enjoy continuous learning and I want to be great at what I do.</p>

    <p>I primarily use TypeScript and C# for my professional full-stack work.</p>

    <p>
    I've mostly been messing around with Rust since the beginning of 2024. 
    Before that I hadn't really created a ton in public, at least not code. Anyway, you can see what that's amounted to on my Github.
